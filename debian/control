Description: Controller Area Network (CAN) interface module - Python 2.x
 The Controller Area Network (CAN, aka "CAN bus") is a bus standard designed
 to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other. It
 has priority based bus arbitration, reliable deterministic
 communication. It is used in cars, trucks, boats, wheelchairs and more.
 .
 The 'can' package provides controller area network support for Python
 developers; providing "common abstractions to different hardware devices", and
 a suite of utilities for sending and receiving messages on a can bus.
 .
 This package provides the bindings for Python 2.x
